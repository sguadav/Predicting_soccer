This is the first live data stream on Kaggle providing a simple yet rich source of all soccer matches around the world 24/7 in real-time.

What makes it unique compared to other datasets?

It is the first live data feed on Kaggle and it is totally free
Unlike “Churn rate” datasets you do not have to wait months to evaluate your predictions; simply check the match’s outcome in a couple of hours
you can use your predictions/analysis for your own benefit instead of spending your time and resources on helping a company maximizing its profit
A Five year old laptop can do the calculations and you do not need high-end GPUs
Couldn’t make it to the top 3 submissions? Nevermind, you still have the chance to get your prize on your own
You can’t get accurate results on all samples? Do not worry, just filter out the hard ones (e.g. ignore international friendly) and simply choose the ones you are sure of.
Need help from human experts for each sample? Every sample comes with at least two opinions from experts
You wish you could add your complementary data? Just contact us and we will try to facilitate it.

Content
Our goal is to identify the outcome of a match as Home, Draw or Away. The variety of sources and nature of information provided in this data stream makes it a unique database. Currently, FIVE servers are collecting data from soccer matches around the world, communicating with each other and finally aggregating the data based on the dominant features learned from 400,000 matches over 7 years. I describe every column and the data collection below in two categories, Category I – Current situation and Category II – Head-to-Head History. Hence, we divide the type of data we have from each team to 4 modes,

Mode 1: we have both Category I and Category II available
Mode 2: we only have Category I available
Mode 3: we only have Category II available
Mode 4: none of Category I and II are available
Below you can find a full illustration of each category.

I. Current situation

Col 1 to 3:

Votes_for_Home    Votes_for_Draw  Votes_for_Away
The most distinctive parts of the database are these 3 columns. We are releasing opinions of over 100 professional soccer analysts predicting the outcome of a match. Their votes is the result of every piece of information they receive on players, team line-up, injuries and the urge of a team to win a match to stay in the league. They are spread around the world in various time zones and are experts on soccer teams from various regions. Our servers aggregate their opinions to update the CSV file until kickoff. Therefore, even if 40 users predict Real-Madrid wins against Real-Sociedad in Santiago Bernabeu on January 6th, 2019 but 5 users predict Real-Sociedad (the away team) will be the winner, you should doubt the home win. Here, the “majority of votes” works in conjunction with other features.

Col 4 to 9:

Weekday    Day Month   Year    Hour    Minute
There are over 60,000 matches during a year, and approximately 400 ones are usually held per day on weekends. More critical and exciting matches, which are usually less predictable, are held toward the evening in Europe. We are currently providing time in Central Europe Time (CET) equivalent to GMT +01:00.

*. Please note that the 2nd row of the CSV file represents the time, data values are saved from all servers to the file.

Col 10 to 13:

Total_Bettors       Bet_Perc_on_Home        Bet_Perc_on_Draw     Bet_Perc_on_Away
This data is recorded a few hours before the match as people place bets emotionally when kickoff approaches. The percentage of the overall number of people denoted as “Total_Bettors” is indicated in each column for “Home,” “Draw” and “Away” outcomes.

Col 14 to 15:

Team_1    Team_2      
The team playing “Home” is “Team1” and the opponent playing “Away” is “Team2”.

Col 16 to 36:

League_Rank_1    League_Rank_2   Total_teams         Points_1    Points_2    Max_points  Min_points  Won_1   Draw_1  Lost_1  Won_2   Draw_2  Lost_2  Goals_Scored_1  Goals_Scored_2  Goals_Rec_1 Goal_Rec_2  Goals_Diff_1    Goals_Diff_2
If the match is between two teams in the same league or a group (e.g. a cup group) then details of teams are reported in the format “home” as index=1 and “Away” as index=2, respectively. The information provided contains,

LeagueRank1 & 2, Team ranks in the league
Total_teams, Total number of teams
Gamesplayed1 & 2, Games played for that league till now which shows if based on Total_teams there have been enough
matches to have meaningful rankings/points by now, e.g. if total_teams is 15 and only 10 matches played then it is just the beginning of the season.
Points1 & 2 ; Max & MinPoints Max & Min_Points, indicating points for both teams, the strongest and weakest teams in the league respectively by that date
WonDrawLost 1 & 2, Number of outcomes for that team in the group
ScoredRecDiff 1 & 2, Number of Goals scored, received and difference for that team till now
II. Head-2-Head history

Col 37 to 38:

Team_1_Found    Team_2_Found
We search for these two teams’ history against each other. “Team1Found” and “Team2Found” are the team names found in their histories, IRRESPECTIVELY. For example, {'Man utd', 'Manchester United', 'Man united', 'Manchester U'} are all similar names referring to 'Manchester United FC'. Hence, you need to double check if these two columns are referring to the same teams, although we check them using string matching algorithms.

Col 39 to 40:

Rank_1    Rank_2
Here we provide rankings of either current or previous league of the teams.

Col 41 to 42:

Win_Perc_1    Win_Perc_2
In the past 15 matches that these teams played against similar teams (e.g. Team A Vs Team C & Team B Vs Team C) called Cross Comparison what was their win percentage.

Col 44 to 45:

Draw_Perc_1    Draw_Perc_2
In the past 15 matches that these teams played against similar teams called Cross Comparison what was their Draw percentage.

Col 43:

League_type_country
What type of league or match does this information belong? A country league, international or FIFA world cup, etc.

Col 46 to 47:

Large_Diff_win    Won_out_of_6
In the past 6 matches that Team1 played against Team2 how many times did one of them win the other? It is only non-zero if it is greater or equal to 4. If it is negative (e.g. -4) then they drew 4 times out of their 6 recent matches.

Col 48 to 49:

Avrage_FT_Goal    Average_HT_Goal
In the past 6 matches how many goals were scored in the average by both teams before Half-Time (HT) or Full-Time (FT)?

Col 50

Number_of_H2H_matches    
Since 2008, how many times did they play against each other including cup and friendly games? Note that team pairs with less than 6 H2H matches are hard to predict.

Col 51

Jumps    
What was the largest gap in years during the past 6 matches? If they played once in 2014 and in 2018, one of them was relegated. Jump values equal to or greater than 3 are harder to predict.

Col 52 to 54

Odds_Home    Odds_Draw   Odds_Away
The probability of each outcome is represented in the form of European odds which also quotes the net total that will be paid out to the correct prediction relative to the stake. You can easily obtain the probability of each outcome by reversing each odds (P(Home)=1/Odds_Home). We highly recommend not to risk on odds less than 1.4 or very large ones. Please refer to Kelly parameter if you plan to optimize your risk and build up your portfolio.
*. In some situations, odds are not finalized until a few hours before the match which we specify them by all odds equal to 1 as a vector of [1,1,1].

Col 55 to 56:

Country_1    Country_2
It specifies which country they are from. However, for countries with low FIFA rankings, it may not be reliable or may even be “Void.” International/Friendly matches between two countries are hard to predict. We also noticed it is quite challenging to predict matches in a league from, for example, England, Middle Eastern countries, the US & Canada.

Col 57

Detail_H2H
We summarize the past 10 or maximum H2H history results in the format of {NumofMonths/Side/Outcome/GoalsHome/GoalsAway} . For every past H2H match we mention elapsed number of months until today, home or away side, outcome, the home team Goals and the away team goals. The Side is the short form of ‘Away/Home’ of the current home team and the match outcome ‘Won/Drew/Lost’. For example, 7/H/L/2/3 means 7 months ago, the current home team, lost in their home against current away team by 2:3

Col 58 to Col 60

Indices_home    Indices_draw    Indices_away
These columns include indices of sports analysts who voted for Home, Draw and Away, respectively.

Finally, in the Training set Col 61 & 62 is the result of the match ‘Goals scored by home’ and ‘Goals scored by Away team’ respectively in Col 61 and Col 62.
